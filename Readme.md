# Layers

Layers is a helper module for [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) web apps. It will
automatically load and loosely couple the layers of your web app.

Layers does not strictly prescribe which layers it supports. Instead it
facilitates the loading of the files which make up your web app running them 
(if they're functions) or simply loading them if they're plain old javascript
objects and adding them as properties of your app/server object.

The app is then passed to the wiring function (see below) which wires up the 
layers of your application.

Note. Layers v1.0.0 is simplification of 0.0.3 and has api breaking changes.
As of v1.0.0 layers will no longer wire up your application. Instead it will
simply load the components and namespace them on your app according to their
layer. Each component can setup routes or whatever is required of it when
it is initialised.

## Installation

To install Layers:

    $ npm install layers

## Usage

The Layers module accepts a server object (or app in the case of Express), 
the path to the files making up your layers and a function which will return
the routes definition object (see Wiring section below).

i.e. for Express:

    var layers = require('layers');
    layers(app, {
        rootPath: __dirname + '/layers'
    });

## Loading Layers by directories

Each directory nested immediately within the layers directory defines a layer.

Each of these layer directories are recursively scanned for javascript files which are imported using require. The result of the require is inspected for two possibilities: 

* An object
* A function which returns an object.

The object loaded or returned from the function is appended to the app object under the layer's namespace.
 
e.g.
 
/path/to/app/layers/controllers/BookController.js becomes app.IoC.controllers.bookController
/path/to/app/layers/services/AuthorService.js becomes app.IoC.services.authorService

One exception is made when loading the layer files: Any file whose name begins with "Base" is ignored.
This name can be overriden by specifying the `excludePrefix` option.

i.e. 

    layers(app, {
        rootPath: __dirname + '/layers',
        excludePrefix: "Abstract"
    });


## Loading Layers by file names

If would like to group your packages by functionality, you can load your layers by file names and you may do it like so:

    layers(app, {
        rootPath: __dirname + '/layers',
        loadRecursivelyPerLayerName: true,
        layers: ['Service', 'Controller'],
        contextName: 'IOCupdated'
    });

e.g.
 
/path/to/app/layers/book/BookController.js becomes app.IOCupdated.controller.bookController
/path/to/app/layers/book/BookService.js becomes app.IOCupdated.service.bookService
/path/to/app/layers/author/AuthorController.js becomes app.IOCupdated.controller.authorController
/path/to/app/layers/author/AuthorService.js becomes app.IOCupdated.service.authorService

Please notice that the context name is configurable

## Layer Callbacks

If would like to run a callback after a layer has been processed, you may do it like so:

    layers(app, {
        rootPath: __dirname + '/layers',
        callbacks: {
            layername: function(){
                doThis();
            }
        }
    });
